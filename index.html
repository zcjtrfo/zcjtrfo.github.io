    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>I train students in <b>Standard Southern British English (SSBE)</b> — the British accent of <b>millions of modern English speakers</b>. This is the accent you’ll hear in most online British English dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary, the Cambridge Dictionary, and the Collins English Dictionary.</p>
    <p><b>Our goal is to move towards a more native-like British accent</b> while tackling your specific frustrations and confusions about pronunciation. Accent training will help you to produce sounds clearly and accurately, and to understand why certain areas of your speech may be misunderstood.</p>
    <p><b>Every session is tailored to your needs</b>, focusing on the areas that will have the biggest impact. The aim is to produce a natural-sounding British accent that <b>feels authentic to you</b>.</p>

    <h2>The Learning Experience</h2>
    
    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p>Each 1-to-1 session lasts 50 minutes and takes place over a video call. You’ll get focused, practical guidance with plenty of opportunity to speak, listen, and practise in real time.</p>
    
    <h3>Tailored to Your Needs</h3>
    <p>Every language has its own unique rhythm and sound system. When we speak a second language, we often try to fit its sounds into the patterns of our first language — sometimes leading to an unnatural rhythm or pronunciation. In our sessions, we’ll focus on the features of English pronunciation that speakers of your native language typically find challenging, so your practice targets the areas that will make the biggest difference for you.</p>
    
    <h3>Tools and Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plenty of example words and sentences to train both your ear and your mouth</li>
      <li>“Before and after” comparisons so you can clearly hear your own progress</li>
      <li>Simple diagrams showing how to position your tongue, lips, and jaw for accurate sounds</li>
      <li>A jargon-free approach — no formal linguistics knowledge required, just clear explanations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Accent Coaching</h2>
    <p>My coaching is beneficial for upper-intermediate or experienced speakers of English who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find that others sometimes struggle to understand their accent</li>
      <li>Are often asked to repeat themselves</li>
      <li>Want to improve the clarity of their speech at work, as a student, or for content creation</li>
      <li>Plan to live in the UK or other English-speaking countries</li>
      <li>Want greater confidence in how they sound speaking English</li>
      <li>Are simply interested in learning how to produce an authentic British accent</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>When to Expect Results</h2>
    <p>You’ll often notice progress in the specific area we focus on during a single session. For broader improvement across your accent, I recommend a minimum of five sessions — giving us time to work on a range of pronunciation features and practise them in context.</p>
    <p>There’s no set limit to the number of sessions you can take. You’re welcome to learn at your own pace, with as much time between sessions as you need.</p>
