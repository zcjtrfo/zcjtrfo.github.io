      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Rob Foster. I have a first-class degree in Linguistics from University College London, and I am CELTA-qualified in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. My formal training in education, phonetics, and phonology has given me a deep understanding of the English language on a technical level.</p>
      <p>Alongside my academic background, I bring years of performance experience as a cellist in orchestras and solo recitals. This has taught me how much the quality of the sound you produce shapes how your audience responds — a principle that applies just as much to speech as it does to music.</p>

    <h2>What is Standard Southern British English?</h2>
    <p>I train students in Standard Southern British English (SSBE) — a contemporary British accent spoken in the south of England and representative of millions of modern English speakers. This is the accent you’ll hear in most online British English dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary, the Cambridge Dictionary, and the Collins English Dictionary.</p>

<section class="approach">

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to move towards a more native-like Southern British accent while tackling your specific frustrations and confusions about pronunciation. Accent training isn’t about mimicking someone else’s voice — it’s about understanding why certain areas of your speech may be misunderstood and learning how to produce sounds clearly and accurately.</p>
    <p>Every session is tailored to your needs, focusing on the areas that will have the biggest impact. The aim is to produce the sounds of a natural-sounding Southern British accent that feels authentic to you — not to “fake” a voice that doesn’t reflect who you are.</p>

    <h2>The Learning Experience</h2>
    
    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p>Each 1-to-1 session lasts 50 minutes and takes place over a video call. You’ll get focused, practical guidance with plenty of opportunity to speak, listen, and practise in real time.</p>
    
    <h3>Tailored to Your Needs</h3>
    <p>Every language has its own unique rhythm and sound system. When we speak a second language, we often try to fit its sounds into the patterns of our first language — sometimes leading to an unnatural rhythm or pronunciation. In our sessions, we’ll focus on the features of English pronunciation that speakers of your native language typically find challenging, so your practice targets the areas that will make the biggest difference for you.</p>
    
    <h3>Tools and Methods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plenty of example words and sentences to train both your ear and your mouth</li>
      <li>“Before and after” comparisons so you can clearly hear your own progress</li>
      <li>Simple diagrams showing how to position your tongue, lips, and jaw for accurate sounds</li>
      <li>A jargon-free approach — no formal linguistics knowledge required, just clear explanations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
    <p>My coaching is designed for learners who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are sometimes asked to repeat themselves when speaking</li>
      <li>Find that others struggle to understand their accent</li>
      <li>Already have an upper-intermediate or advanced level of English</li>
      <li>Want to improve their British accent — especially in Standard Southern British English</li>
    </ul>

<section class="progress">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>When to Expect Results</h2>
    <p>You’ll often notice progress in the specific area we focus on during a single session. For broader improvement across your accent, I recommend a minimum of five sessions — giving us time to work on a range of pronunciation features and practise them in context.</p>
    <p>There’s no set limit to the number of sessions you can take. You’re welcome to learn at your own pace, with as much time between sessions as you need.</p>
